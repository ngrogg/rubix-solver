# Rubix-solver
An attempt to solve a rubix cube programatically. In it's current iteration, it works manually
via a menu that alters several arrays that represents the sides. The cube itself is represented
via ASCII to show each of the sides. 

There will be an automatic version that uses machine learning as development progresses.

## Theory
This covers the ideas behind reaching the solutions.
